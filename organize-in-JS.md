# Organize in JS
##### April 27, 2020

There are to major patterns for organizing JS code: 
**classes** and **modules**


## Classes

| Note |
| :--- |
| A class in a program is a definition of a "type" of custom data structure that includes both data and 
behaviors that operate on that data. Classes define how such a data structure works, but
classes are not themselves concrete values. To get a concrete value that you can use in the program, a class
must be *instantiated* with the new keyword|
